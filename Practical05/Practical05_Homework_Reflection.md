1. Separation of Concerns:

Model is responsible for the managment of data such as the inserting, updating and deleting of data. View is responsible for displaying data to the user by collecting user input. Controller is responsible for the actions between the model and view by handling the users input and interacting with the model to response back to the user.

Having a seperate frontend view helps to improve clarity by spliting front and backend. This ensures that the backend focus mainly on processing and managing data. This improve readability and debugging in future.

2. Robustness and Security:

I think by week 4 it already became easier to identify and fix bug related by having sperated into 3 main components (MVC) which contained validation middleware and error handling such as input validation. However with the additional frontend in week 5 it helped it to further isolate between client and server side. 

3. Challenges and Problem Solving: 

The most challenging part was figuring what went wrong when I used the same code except sorting them into simplfied and making them more readable. 

Compared to week 3 now with the code split into front and back end meant that in the event of a bug where I had to debug it made it clearer and more efficient

4. Experiential Learning:

I allowed me to learn how to catch error and debug when something went wrong. It also allowed me to apply what I learnt instead of js pasting.
