2 Challenges faced was making sure the code didnt error after moving them
3 The MVC made code more organised as opposed to dumping all the code into app.js
4 Mvc is more organised as the code are seperated according to their purpose making debugging easier
5 Allocating code in their respective plays such as model and controller meant that the files can be reused in other areas and also improves readability in the event of debugging

1 By implementing input validation middleware ensures that only safe code can reach the database
2 It treats the input as a plain value instead of excuting the command
3 Brute force atatck. Limit the number of attacks allowed per minute
