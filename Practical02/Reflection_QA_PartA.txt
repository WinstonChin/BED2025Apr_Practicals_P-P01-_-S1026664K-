I learnt about how REST APIs communicate with other systems using HTTP methods. 
Through try and error I managed to understand how each of the HTTP work
Yes, as I did not know the exact phrase or line to type making minor mistakes like additional of {} when doing the update with the id which cause the code to fail

We use POST for creating as it comes with an id that we can use later to update with PUT
404 Not Found should be returned when an error occurs
